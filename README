Huffman encoding is a form of data compression that is useful for text. Normally, (English)
text is encoded so that each letter occupies the same amount of space â€“ typically a byte. 
Huffman encoding works by observing that some letters occur more frequently than others (e.g. E is
very common, Z is very uncommon.) Using this, it constructs variable-length encodings so that
frequently occurring letters occupy less space, individually than their infrequent counterparts.

This project implements a priority queue based on a min heap, and using that
as the basis of a Huffman encoder.


Build the Java project

To test your work: 
linux> make clean; make run

To run the same autograder that Autolab will use when you submit:
linux> ./driver.sh

Files:
README                 This file
Makefile               Makefile to build/run project
driver.sh              Script run by Autolab when a project is submitted (uses Makefile)
*.java                 Java files for this projec
